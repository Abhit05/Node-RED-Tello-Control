# Learn about Node-RED

**Node-RED** is a open source project and flow-based programming environment from the
[JS Foundation](https://js.foundation/community/projects). It provides a palette of nodes that allow users
to very quickly wire up IoT applications that can combine streams of both physical and digital events.
Its Node.JS runtime is easy to install on both devices and the cloud, and provides a framework for
extending its capabilities.
