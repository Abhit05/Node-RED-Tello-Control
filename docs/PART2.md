# Install Node-RED

Before programming the Tello using Node-RED, several pre-requiste software packages need to be installed on your laptop or workstation.  

To control the drone you need to connect your laptop or workstation to the drone WiFi access point, so Node-RED needs to be running locally, rather than in the cloud.

Once Node-RED is installed, several additional Node-RED nodes will be necessary. Install the following nodes using the [Node-RED Manage Palette](https://github.com/binnes/esp8266Workshop/blob/master/en/part3/NODERED.md#step-3---how-to-install-additional-node-red-nodes) or via the npm command line:

- [node-red-dashboard](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-dashboard) - A set of dashboard nodes for Node-RED
- [node-red-node-watson](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-node-watson) - A collection of Node-RED nodes for IBM Watson services

into your Node-RED editor.
