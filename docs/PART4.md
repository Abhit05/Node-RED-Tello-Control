# Build a Node-RED dashboard

In Part 3 you constructed a Node-RED flow to send commands to the drone. In this Part 4 exercise, we will create a Node-RED Dashboard with buttons that send the SDK commands. Recall in Part 1, you installed the node-red-dashboard nodes and you should find the Node-RED Dashboard nodes in your palette.

The video below shows how button nodes can be configured to send the SDK commands to the drone.

## Task

Begin with the [Part4 starter flow](/flows/starter/part4_starter.json) and add button nodes to the following commands:

- emergency
- up 50cm
- down 50cm
- right 50cm
- left 50cm
- forward 50cm
- back 50cm
- rotate clockwise 90ยบ
- rotate counter-clockwise 90ยบ
- rotate clockwise 360ยบ
- flip forward

Launch the Node-RED Dashboard by turning to the Dashboard tab in the right menu and then click on the launch button.
