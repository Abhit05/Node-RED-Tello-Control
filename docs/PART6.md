## Task

You should take the [part6 starter flow](/flows/starter/part6_starter.json), which provides you will all the subflow nodes as shown in the video.  You should create a patrol mission for your drone, which comprises of the following tasks:

- Take off
- Descend 1 meter
- Rotate 360ยบ clockwise
- Complete a square by moving forward 50cm, then rotating 90ยบ and repeating 4 times
- Land
  
Be sure to add sufficient delays into your solution to allow the drone to complete all the moves.  Add a new group to the dashboard and then create a button to allow you to start the mission from the dashboard.

You can import a [sample solution](/flows/solutions/solution.json) if you need help or want to compare your solution with a sample solution.
